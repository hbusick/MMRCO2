# MMRCO2
Repository Storing a Project on Global Maternal Mortality Rates and CO2 Emmissions

To run this code in the RStudio workspace all .csv files should be located in the same location as 'Final_Paper_1.Rmd'. You may need to install additional packages before successfully running the RMD. Once installed, all necessary packages are located in the first code chunk of the RMD. For the completed result in html/web-browser format see the file titled 'Final_Paper_1.html'. This will load the knitted html format of the project that displays the final paper and figures in an easily readable format.
